Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1
1. Allow multiple request and responses to be sent to the TCP connection
2.  It support pipelining. This reduce latency of protocol and improve performance
3. Ability to specify cache control directives which can reduce the amount of data
4. Lack of multiplexing. Allows a single request and response to be sent over a single connection at a time
5. Inability to prioritize request
6. No support for server push. The server cannot initiate the transfer of data to the client.

HTTP 2:
1. Allows multiple request and response to be sent over a single connection
2. Uses binary protocol instead of text based protocol.
3. Allows the client to specify the priority of request
4. Allows the server to send multiple response to a single request
