Objects and its Internal Representation
An object is a collection of properties.
Properties are association of keys and value.
Keys are string.
Values can be any data type including other objects.
The internal representation of Javascript object involves managing its properties and prototype linkage in memory, allowing flexible and dynamic object oriented programming in the language.
